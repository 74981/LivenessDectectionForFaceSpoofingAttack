This folder will contains:
	1. executable of current SVM model (train+test)
	2. Processed data (train+test) file stores data and labels after running the executable.
	3. SVM models after runnning the executable. 

	note: A generic python program in the src/python/MLP folder can be used to train a MLP model on the same dataset. The default train and test set will be loaded from the processed data files generated by the C++ program, however it can be set otherwise if want to.
