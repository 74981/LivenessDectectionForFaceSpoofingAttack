# LivenessDectectionForFaceSpoofingAttack

### This is a project designed to handle face spoofing attack in the face recognition camera. (on going)

This project utilized Rotation Invariant Uniform LBP pattern in different color spaces to distinguish between real person and fake images or videos. Currently, prediction is made by trained SVM model taking normalized LBP feature vector.
